pytivometa
==========

pytivometa is a script to create the metadata that pytivo can use when serving
media files from a computer to a TiVo.  It uses metadata from
https://www.thetvdb.com/ and http://www.imdb.com to create text files and put
them in the proper place (near the associated video files) for pytivo to find
them.

Based on the original pytivometathis by Graham Dunn and later Josh Harding
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/pytivometathis/).  This version has been
ported to python3 and otherwised revised.
